## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/KarahanS/Self-Supervised-Learning-for-Medical-Image-Analysis.git
```
2. We have used Python 3.10 to obtain our results. Although the requirements should work with higher (and some lower) Python versions, you may want to ensure working Python 3.10 environment for reproducibility. 
 Create a virtual environment and activate it:
